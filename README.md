# Connect Four

## A simple p5 game based on the popular board game Connect Four

## How to Play 

The circle coin at the top's color represents whose turn it is to play. 

When it is your turn, click above the column you want to place your token in and it will fall down! 

The computer will automatically figure out who wins and will keep track of who has the most wins (red or yellow) in one playing session.
